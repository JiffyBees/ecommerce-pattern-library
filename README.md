Cozy commerce website

---

## Project description
This pattern library is for the commerce cozy webpage. This library only includes pieces for four main pages and individual product pages. These files are meant to be as inclusive to a real full webpage as possible.

## rationale homepage
The homepage has a number of cards meant to link to almost all three other pages, especially products. The style I have for my whole website is supposed to reflect real world corporate e-commerce websites. Indigo was also a website that inspired me.

## rationale products
The products page was styled off of book stores, as many online book stores streamlined the process of displaying items. Because many categories have so many items very few items besides the cards should be displayed.

## rationale checkout
The checkout form is very simple with a details form, checkout form lower, and navigation system on the bottom of the checkout section. Only the basic purchase system is required alongside an always accessible cart button on every page to make flow in the website consistent.

## rationale product details
The product details page is meant to have the product info and details and specs, along with some additional purchase options.
There is not meant to be many extra links in the page as the focus is to go through each option until going to checkout.
